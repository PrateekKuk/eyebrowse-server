eyebrowse-server
===========

Eyebrowse allows users to automatically track and selectively publish their use of the Web in real-time. Currently, there is no simple way for the end-user to keep track of the vast time spent browsing the Web. Since there is no clear picture of how users access the Web as a whole, the Eyebrowse Project aims to allow public logging of Web usage through client-side services. Eyebrowse gives control to the user, while providing data for public use.

The concept of Eyebrowse is to gather browsing history from participating users. Depending on the particular distribution, it may either be used in a context where the data goes into a public repository, or it may be used in a context where the data is shared in a controlled way (such as among a group of users, but not publicly). 

The project [eyebrowse-server](https://github.com/haystack/eyebrowse-server) aims to build a server that can receive the data from users' installs of eyebrowse.
