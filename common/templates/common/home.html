        <h1>Welcome to Eyebrowse!</h1>
        <BR />
        <p> When we go outside, a lot of the fun comes from seeing what other people are doing.  
        We can follow (or steer away from) the crowd. We can bump into friends. 
        We can simply sit back and enjoy observing the ebb and flow of people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-style: italic;"> Wouldn't it be interesting to do the same on the web? </p>

	<p> Eyebrowse aims to create a social outdoors for your web browsing.
	</p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="span4">
			<h4>Share.</h4>
			By making yourself visible on sites you designate, you
			open up a wealth of new social opportunities. You can chat in real-time or post comments to any webpage. 
			You'll be able to "bump into
			people" and notice when your friends are on the same sites as you.
			Your friend's browsing paths can lead you to
			interesting new web content, and yours can lead them. You can see places that are attracting a crowd while
			it's happening, or follow well-trodden paths.  
		</div>
		<div class="span4">
			<h4>Track.</h4>
			By monitoring your own browsing habits, you can better understand how you are spending your time on the web. 
			Built-in visualizations within Eyebrowse of your browsing activity will make it easy to spot trends.
			Finally, you can share aspects of your browsing habits to others and allow your friends to help you maintain a 
			sensible information diet.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span4">
			<h4>Take control.</h4>
			As an Eyebrowse user, you specify the websites you wish to be visible on, and those are the only
			ones where you are visible to other users and they can see where you've been. 
			We will never track your visits to websites that you have not explicitly given permission to be visible on.
			You can also edit which websites you wish to be visible on at any time.
		</div>
		<div class="span4">
			<h4>Contribute.</h4>
			As a
			community, we'll be able to build up a publicly visible map of the
			ebbs and flows of traffic on the web.
			By contributing your data to this public repository of web activity, you'll make new 
			research and exciting projects possible. If you're a hacker, designer, or researcher, you can start
			right now to play with Eyebrowse data.
			We're excited about all the great things that can be learned or apps or visualizations that can be built
			from this data, which is why we have an <a href="/api_docs">API</a> for you to use.
