        <h1>Welcome to Eyebrowse!</h1>
        <BR />
        <p> When we go outside, a lot of the fun comes from seeing what other people are doing.  
        We can follow (or steer away from) the crowd. We can bump into friends. 
        We can simply sit back and enjoy observing the ebb and flow of people.
	</p>
	<p style="font-style: italic;"> Wouldn't it be interesting to do the same on the web? </p>

<p> Eyebrowse aims to create a social outdoors for your web browsing.
</p>

<div class="home-table">
<table width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td width="42%">
		<h4>Share.</h4>
		By making yourself visible on sites you designate, you
		open up a wealth of new social opportunities. You can chat in real-time or post comments to any webpage 
		you wish, not just the ones that have those features enabled. 
		You'll be able to "bump into
		people" and notice when your friends are on the same sites as you.
		Your friend's browsing paths can lead you to
		interesting new web content, and yours can lead them. You can see places that are attracting a crowd while
		it's happening, or follow well-trodden paths.  
		</td>
		<td width="25%">
		<h4>Take control.</h4>
		As an Eyebrowse user, you specify the websites you wish to be visible on, and those are the only
		ones where you are visible to other users and they can see where you've been. 
		We will never track your visits to websites that you have not explicitly given permission to be visible on.
		</td>
		<td width="33%">
		<h4>Contribute.</h4>
		As a
		community, we'll be able to build up a publicly visible map of the
		ebbs and flows of traffic on the web.
		By contributing your data to this public repository of web activity, you'll make new 
		research and cool projects possible. 
		We're excited about all the great things that can be learned or apps or visualizations that can be built
		from this data, which is why we have an <a href="/api_docs">API</a> for you to use.
