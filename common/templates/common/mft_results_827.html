  <h3>Moral Foundations Questionnaire</h3>
  <p>
    Thank you for completing this survey!
  </p>

  <p>The scale you completed was the "Moral Foundations Questionnaire", developed by Jesse Graham and Jonathan Haidt at the University of Virginia.</p>

  <p>
    <h4>What are moral foundations?</h4>
    <p>
      Moral Foundations Theory states that human moral thought is based upon five fundamental psychological foundtions that are found across cultures. These five foundations are:
    </p>
  </p>
  <table class="foundations">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="foundation" style="background-color: #ffb1b1">Care/harm</span></td>
        <td><span class="description"> This foundation is related to an ability to feel (and dislike) the pain of others. It underlies virtues of kindness, gentleness, and nurturance.</span></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="foundation" style="background-color: #ffe4b1">Fairness/cheating</span></td>
        <td><span class="description"> This foundation generates ideas of justice, rights, and autonomy.</span></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="foundation" style="background-color: #b1ffba">Loyalty/betrayal</span></td>
        <td><span class="description"> This foundation underlies virtues of patriotism and self-sacrifice for the group. </span></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="foundation" style="background-color: #b1ddff">Authority/subversion</span></td>
        <td><span class="description"> This foundation underlies virtues of leadership and followership, including deference to legitimate authority and respect for traditions.</span></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="foundation" style="background-color: #f6b1ff">Sanctity/degradation</span></td>
        <td><span class="description">This foundation underlies notions of striving to live in an elevated, less carnal, more noble way.</span></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    <h4>Where does this scale come from?</h4>
    <p>The idea behind the scale is that human morality is the result of biological and cultural evolutionary processes that made us sensitive to many different (and often competing) issues. Everyone holds each of these five foundations - just in differing proportions.</p>

    <p>Some of these issues are about treating other individuals well (the first two foundations - harm and fairness). Other issues are about how to be a good member of a group or supporter of social order and tradition (the last three foundations).</p>

    <p>
    <h4>Liberals and conservatives</h4>
      Research shows that liberals and conservatives have distinctly differing moral foundations.<p>
    <p>
      <strong style="color: #97beea">Liberals</strong> prioritize issues of care and fairness.<br/>
      <strong style="color: #ea9797">Conservatives</strong> prioritize issues of loyalty, authority, and sanctity, though they also value care and fairness.
    </p>

    <p>This difference explains why the two sides often talk past each other in the culture war. For example, may liberals support legalizing gay marriage (to be fair and compassionate), whereas many conservatives are reluctant to change the nature of marriage and the family, basic building blocks of society.</p>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h4>Your foundations</h4>
    In the graph below, your scores on each foundation are shown in <strong style="color: #b5a2c3">purple</strong>. The scores of liberals are shown in <strong style="color: #97beea">blue</strong>, and the scores of conservatives are shown in <strong style="color: #ea9797">red</strong>. The liberal and conservative numbers are gathered from tens of thousands of conservatives/liberals who also took this survey. 

    <p>Pay attention to the relative proportions of your bars.</p>

    <h4>So what does this mean?</h4>
    <p>
      Are each of your foundations at roughly the same level? If so, you are more in line with the moral foundations of conservatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you value care and fairness more than the rest? If so, you are more in line with the moral foundations of liberals. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If neither of these apply to you, there are other less-common political ideologies that have correlated with moral foundations as well: for instance, libertarians identify strongly with fairness over all others.
    </p>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h4>What can I do with this knowledge?</h4>
    <p>
      An incredibly effective way to have political discussions is to <strong>frame your points with the other person's moral foundations</strong>. When people talk about their beliefs, they tend to talk in the frame of their own moral foundations. However, that gets lost on people from the other side, because they don't relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research has shown that <strong>we can get people from one side to support policies from the other side</strong> if they are framed using results from moral foundations theory. In one study, researchers took traditionally conservative views such as making English the official language of the United States, and framed it using a liberal moral foundation of fairness - "making English the official language of the United States leads to fairer outcomes for immigrants by helping them avoid discrimination". They were able to sway a significant number of liberals using this framing.
