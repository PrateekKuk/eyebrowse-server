<h3> What is Eyebrowse? </h3>
Eyebrowse is a social web browsing tool. It allows you to pick websites that you consider like 
public spaces in real life and makes you publicly visible on them. Just like in real life,
you can bump into friends, chat with others, and see what others are doing while browsing the web.
The tool is made up of a website where you have a profile and you can view other people's eyebrowse history,
as well as a Chrome browser plugin where you can see, while you're browsing the parts of the web
you consider public, the other people
that are on the same webpage as you and chat or leave comments on any pages.

<h3> Why would I use Eyebrowse? </h3>
There are a lot of fun and interesting uses and opportunities that Eyebrowse can provide.
First, you can now have discussions and leave notes on any webpage, not just the ones that have
those features enabled. You can get a picture of your own browsing habits as well as how other people
in the world are browsing the web, all in real time. For instance, you could discover where crowds are
congregating on the web or find some well-trodden paths. There are so many possibilities, which is why
we have released an <a href="/api_docs">API</a> for you to use if you are interested. 
You can download your own data or the
entire Firehose and uncover interesting findings or build cool visualizations. You can even build a new app 
that connects to the Eyebrowse API. An additional benefit to contributing your own data is that you
help researchers working on important problems related to information retrieval, social
computing, and human-computer interaction.

<h3> What's your motivation for building Eyebrowse? </h3>

We have built Eyebrowse for many reasons. 

<BR />
<BR />
First, we're really interested in the possibilities for social
interaction, sharing, and content discovery that Eyebrowse can provide.
We also think that there is a lot of opportunity in being able to visualize the paths and ebbs and flows of 
traffic on the web.
<BR />
<BR />
Second, in building this system, we wish to demonstrate that it is possible to have a system
that asks users permission before tracking them instead of indiscriminately tracking all websites
that users go to, including the ones that they prefer to keep private. We believe that there are some
websites that users do not mind being tracked on and others where they do mind, but it is currently cumbersome
or difficult for users to take control. This system is a proof-of-concept to show that browser tracking can be
permission-based without being annoying or tiresome for users.
<BR />
<BR />
Finally, we hope by releasing the data that Eyebrowse collects, we can help researchers, data scientists, builders,
and designers learn and create interesting and useful things. We think that areas like quantified self, 
information retrieval, social computing, and many more could benefit from the data we collect.

<h3> How much of my browsing data does Eyebrowse collect? </h3>

Eyebrowse only collects data from the domains that you give it permission to collect. You give 
Eyebrowse permission when you add a domain to your whitelist. After you've done that, anytime you
visit a webpage that is a part of that domain, you will show up as present on that domain within
the Eyebrowse Chrome plugin, and your Eyebrowse feed will register a visit to that webpage.

</p>

<a name="public">&nbsp;</a>
<BR>
<P>
<h3> Is the data I put on my Eyebrowse feed public? </h3>

Yes. At this moment, all the data that goes to your Eyebrowse is publicly available, as in any person
can create an Eyebrowse account and see it. Likewise, your data will show up in the public API
and in the link to the Eyebrowse firehose from your home page. Only add domains to your whitelist
that you are comfortable sharing publicly.

</p>


<a name="anonymous">&nbsp;</a>
<BR>
<P>
<h3> Is it possible for me to use Eyebrowse anonymously? </h3>

It is possible for you to create an account and not use a username or profile image that links back to you or reveal
your email. However, it is often easy to reveal your identity from your online traces without realizing it.
Therefore, we can not guarantee that your anonymity will be preserved if you are whitelisting any domains.
We recommend that you only whitelist the domains that you are comfortable associating with yourself.
